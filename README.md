## 📚 What is Skills Hub?

Skills Hub is a collaborative repository of in-depth guides, best practices, and design patterns for TypeScript-based web development. Each skill provides detailed documentation with real-world code examples, explanations, and battle-tested recommendations.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a centralized knowledge base for developers working with:
- **TypeScript** as the primary language
- **Modern web frameworks** (frontend and backend)
- **Full-stack development** patterns
- **Testing strategies** and quality assurance
- **API design** and architecture
- **Performance optimization** techniques
- **DevOps and CI/CD** practices

## 🏗️ Skill Structure

Each skill follows a standardized structure to ensure consistency and ease of use:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md         # Metadata and quick reference
└── AGENTS.md        # Complete guide with detailed examples
```

### SKILL.md Components
- Metadata (name, description, version, tags)
- When to apply the skill
- Category priorities table
- Quick reference guide
- Links to complete documentation

### AGENTS.md Components
- Organized by categories with priority levels
- Code examples (incorrect vs correct)
- Detailed explanations of "why"
- Practical commands and utilities
- References and additional resources
